To chage tasks within the applications press the numbers from 1 to 6 and ESC to exit the application. 
Tasks 2 and 3 have multiple options, the first option is selected by default at the beggining. To change options press a b or c.

For exercice 6 you can use D and I to decrease and increase the brush size respectively.

We couldn't optimize task 5 therefore I recomend to select it just after you run the application since we couldn't solve a problem witht he elapsed time
and the application brakes because of the particles acceleration.
